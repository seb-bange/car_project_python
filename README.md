# ** ðŸš— 2. Car Data Analysis (Python)**

**Objective:** Clean, transform, and analyze car specification and pricing data to identify market trends and key relationships.

**Overview:**
This project utilized Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis of a comprehensive car dataset. The dataset included essential details such as vehicle make, model, engine specifications, fuel types, and pricing. The goal was to uncover significant patterns and trends in the automotive market and explore the variables that influence pricing and market segmentation.

**Key Steps:**
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The first step involved handling missing values, standardizing inconsistent formats, and filtering the dataset to include only cars from 1995 onward. This step was essential to ensure the data quality and to focus on relevant and up-to-date vehicle data for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: To enhance the analytical depth, new features such as Total MPG (total fuel efficiency) and Price per Horsepower were created. These metrics provide valuable insights into a vehicleâ€™s efficiency and its value in relation to its performance characteristics.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A thorough exploration of pricing structures, horsepower distributions, and market segmentation was carried out. Specific attention was paid to pricing trends in relation to various engine specifications and vehicle types.

**Skills Applied:**
- Data preprocessing and transformation with Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy: These tools allowed efficient handling and transformation of large datasets to prepare them for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistical Insights: Using Pandas and NumPy, initial trends and relationships between variables were identified.
- Correlation Analysis: Correlations between various variables, particularly between vehicle prices and engine power, were calculated to uncover key relationships.
- Data Visualization: With the help of Matplotlib and Seaborn, various visualizations were created to present the results of the exploratory analysis in an easily understandable and visually appealing manner. These visualizations helped identify patterns and outliers important for gaining deeper insights into the market dynamics.

**Tools & Technologies used:**
- Python (Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn): These libraries provided a seamless integration of data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

**Key Findings:**
- A strong correlation was identified between engine horsepower and vehicle prices. Cars with higher horsepower tend to have significantly higher prices.
- Larger vehicles and premium models were found to have substantially higher prices. These models often exceed the price thresholds for standard vehicles and tend to feature more high-end specifications.
- By analyzing fuel efficiency, it was observed that vehicles with different transmission types exhibited varying levels of efficiency. This insight allowed for a deeper exploration of efficiency trends in relation to vehicle types and drive systems.
